      <description>Everyone should get login information for a Datadog account they can use for this session. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t received this information (and you are here in the room with us), contact the instructors. This will include a username and password for a Datadog account, as well as the IP Address for the load balancer of your cluster of servers.
 Login to your Demo Datadog Account. Note: Use this demo even if you have the credentials for your company&amp;rsquo;s account since it has been setup to collect data from the demo environment Navigate to the Metrics Explorer (https://app.</description>

      <description>First Dashboard  From the menu, return to the dashboard you created earlier. Drag and drop a timeseries widget onto the first well on the canvas. Notice that you can change the visualization at any time without having to drag another widget on the canvas. In the first textbox under Choose metrics and events, select elasticsearch.search.query.current. Notice that the textbox supports a fuzzy search so i can enter elseaseaqc and get to the right metric much more quickly.</description>

      <description> 8 Types of Functions  Interpolation - Aligns multiple series together Timeshift - Helpful for comparing metrics with previously reported values Rate - Compare metric values with their previous value Count - Keep track of the number of values reported in your graphs Smoothing - Even out the values on your graph Time Aggregation - Smooth out your graphs by aggregating timeseries data Ranking - Avoid clutter by viewing only the most relevant timeseries Algorithm - Analyze your metrics compared to concurrent or previous metric data  </description>

      <description># Monitoring Math Getting more out of your graphs --- #Metric Aggregation --- # Timeseries Data * Metrics are stored as timeseries based on combinations of the metric name and tag combinations * Queries require an aggregation function (sum, min, max, avg) to aggregate over timeseries matching the query * Aggregation is applied at each point on the graph, bringing multiple timeseries value into one point on the graph --- # Aggregation Example * Start with a basic query â€œsum:system.</description>

      <description># Creating the Right Alerts --- # Two Rules for Effective Alerting 1. Alert liberally; page judiciously 1. Page on symptoms, rather than causes -- # What does that mean? * Create lots of alerts for everything. * Alerts become the living history of your infrastructure * But only notify people about the **Work Metrics** going awry --- # Paged Alerts Should Always Be Easily Actionable ## Alerts should be: * Grokkable at 3AM, drunk, with one eye closed * Filled with all the info you need * Including who to wake up if you have trouble * Consumable by the non-experts --- # Levels of Alerting Urgency ## Alerts as Records (low severity) Use to document the system.</description>

      <description>Monitoring on Docker This exercise requires Docker to be installed somewhere. You could do this on your laptop, on a Vagrant box, or on a cloud provider. If installing for the first time visit https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;amp;offering=community to get it setup.
 Navigate to the Agent Installation page in the Datadog application (https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/docker). Select Docker and copy the first command. Run it where ever you have Docker installed. You now have the Datadog agent running on your Docker machine.</description>

      <description>This site was created for the First Annual Datadog Customer Summit in NYC on October 26, 2016 and updated for the second Summit in San Francisco on March 14, 2017. We had about 40 people in the room the first time around and it was very successful.
The site is built using Hugo (http://gohugo.io) and Reveal.js (http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).
