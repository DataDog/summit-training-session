      <description>This exercise requires Docker to be installed somewhere. You could do this on your laptop, on the Vagrant box you created earlier, or on any machine you can remotely access. If installing for the first time on your laptop, see https://www.docker.com/products/overview for links to the installers for your platform.
 Navigate to the Agent Installation page in the Datadog application (https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/docker). Select Docker and copy the first command. Run it where ever you have Docker installed.</description>
