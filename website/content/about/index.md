This site was created for the First Annual Datadog Customer Summit in NYC on October 26, 2016. We had about 40 people in the room and it was very successful. 

The site is built using Hugo (http://gohugo.io) and Reveal.js (http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).

To see the source for this site, visit https://github.com/DataDog/summit-training-session and go to the website directory. 

To rebuild, run `hugo` from that directory and it should build /docs. Github.com then publishes whatever is in the docs directory to the GithubPages.

To build out the environment used in the first 4 sections of the training, review the readme in the repo.
