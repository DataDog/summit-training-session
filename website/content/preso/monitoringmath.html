#Metric Aggregation
--
# Timeseries Data
* Metrics are stored as timeseries based on combinations of the metric name and tag combinations
* Queries require an aggregation function (sum, min, max, avg) to aggregate over timeseries matching the query
* Aggregation is applied at each point on the graph, bringing multiple timeseries value into one point on the graph
--
# Aggregation Example
* Start with a basic query “sum:system.disk.used{host:oracle-xe}”
* Disk metrics are tagged by disk using the “device” tag, with an individual timeseries created on each host for every device reported

--
# Aggregation Example

* Using “by {device}” break the graph down to show one stacked are per disk
* Sum from previous graph is now broken down by individual disks making up the previous aggregate

#Functions

# Function Types
* Arithmetic
* Interpolation
* Timeshift
* Rate
* Count
* Smoothing
* Time Aggregation
* Ranking
* Algorithm
---
# Arithmetic
## Absolute Value
* Always displays the absolute value of the metric.

## Log2/Log10
* The occasional spike may skew the scale of a graph. Log will smooth out the spike while not eliminating them.

## Cumulative Sum / Integral
* Adds each value shown on the graph cumulatively.
---
# Interpolation - .fill()

* Not meant to fill in empty spaces, but to align multiple series together
* Helpful for aggregation and arithmetic across multiple sources
* Available options include linear interpolation or inserting 0’s or the most recent value
* More on this in our KBs: http://dtdg.co/kb-fill

# Timeshift

# Rate
## Compare metric values with their previous value
--
# per_second()
Compare the metric with the previous value, returning difference in value divided by the difference in time
![](../../images/monitoringmath/rate_per_second.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->

--
# per_minute()
Compare the metric with the previous value, returning difference in value divided by the difference in time

![](../../images/monitoringmath/rate_per_minute.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->
Note: 60 * the per_second() value
--
# per_hour()  Rate
Compare the metric with the previous value, returning difference in value divided by the difference in time
![](../../images/monitoringmath/rate_per_hour.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->

Note: 3600 * the per_second() value
--
# dt()
![](../../images/monitoringmath/dt.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->
Note: Time in seconds between the current and previous points
--
# diff()
![](../../images/monitoringmath/diff.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->
Note: The difference in value between the current and previous points
--
# derivative()
![](../../images/monitoringmath/derivative.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->

Note: 1st order derivative function applied to the graph: diff() / dt()
---
# Count
## Keep track of the number of values reported in your graphs
--
# count_nonzero()
![](../../images/monitoringmath/count_nonzero.png)<!-- .element: style="background: none; box-shadow: none; width : 100%" -->
Note: Current track of all non-zero values graphed at a given moment in time

---
# Smoothing
## Even out the values on your graph
--
# ewma_3()
![](../../images/monitoringmath/ewma_3.png)
Note: Exponentially weighted moving average spanning 3 points (previous, current, next)
--
# ewma_5()

--
# ewma_10()

# median_3()

Note: Median value spanning 9 points
---
# Time Aggregation
## Smooth out your graphs by aggregating timeseries data
--
# .rollup($method, $time)
* Apply aggregation $method to multiple values over $time in seconds
* Available methods: sum, min, max, avg
* Allows overriding the default rollup function used for smoothing graphs over larger timeframes
* Various methods available can allow preservation of spikes/dips in graphs
* More on our default rollups and the rollup function’s use in our KBs: http://dtdg.co/zoomsmooth
---
# Ranking
## Avoid clutter by viewing only the most relevant timeseries
--
# top()
Avoid clutter by viewing only the most relevant timeseries
![](../../images/monitoringmath/top.png)
Note: * Select the top series responsive to a given query, according to a provided ranking method
* Parameters for the top function include
  * metric query itself
  * the number of series you’d like returned
  * a ranking function (one of 'max', 'min', 'last', 'l2norm', or 'area')
  * sort order (either 'desc' for descending order or 'asc' for ascending order)
--
# top_offset()
Avoid clutter by viewing only the most relevant timeseries

![](../../images/monitoringmath/topoffset.png)

Note: Similar to top(), except with an additional offset parameter, which controls where in the ordered sequence of series the graphing starts.

For example, an offset of 2 would start graphing at the number 3 ranked series, according to the chosen ranking metric.

# Algorithm
## Analyze your metrics compared to concurrent or previous metric data
--
#outliers()
* Compare timeseries values with each other
* Highlights individual timeseries based on ones that deviate too far from the norm at a given moment in time
* More on the available DBSCAN and MAD functions used here: http://dtdg.co/outlierdetect
--
#anomalies()
* Compares historic metric data
* Allows comparison of the current value with norms calculated across previous timeframes
* Can alert on anomalous spikes/dips in metric values based on deviation from this norm
