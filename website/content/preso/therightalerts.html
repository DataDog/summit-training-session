# Creating the Right Alerts
---
# Two Rules for Effective Alerting
1.  Alert liberally; page judiciously
1.  Page on symptoms, rather than causes
--
# What does that mean?
* Create lots of alerts for everything.
* Alerts become the living history of your infrastructure
* But only notify people about the **Work Metrics** going awry
---
# Paged Alerts Should Always Be Easily Actionable
## Alerts should be:
* Grokkable at 3AM, drunk, with one eye closed
* Filled with all the info you need
  *     Including who to wake up if you have trouble
* Consumable by the non-experts
---
# Levels of Alerting Urgency
## Alerts as Records (low severity)
Use to document the system. Helpful when trying to troubleshoot later.
## Alerts as Notifications (moderate severity)
These are things that require intervention, but not right away
## Alerts as Pages (high severity)
Wake the right people up and address it immediately!

# How to Determine the Right Level of Urgency?
## Is the issue real?
Don't notify on things that shouldn't be important, like:
* Test environments
* System down during planned upgrade
--
# How to Determine the Right Level of Urgency?
## Does the issue require attention?
* If you can automate a response, do it
* The costs of calling someone away from work/sleep/personal time is significant. Avoid if you can.
* If it's **real** and **require's attention**, notify and let the engineer prioritize.
--
# How to Determine the Right Level of Urgency?
## Is the issue urgent?
* IIF the issue is **real** AND **require's attention** AND is **urgent**, generate a page.
---
# Page on Symptoms
## **Work metrics** not Resource metrics

# ...except when its an early warning...

# Early Warning Signs
Also page on the early warning signs that come before really bad things:
* If you are about to run out of disk
* If you are about to hit a quota limit
* etc.

# Eight Types

* **Host** - notify on the status of the agent heartbeat
* **Metric** - metrics collected by agent or API can trigger alerts
* **Integration** - same as metrics above, applied to specific integrations
* **Process** - check if a process is running or not
* **Network Service** - check if a network endpoint is active or not
* **Custom Check** - run a custom script and alert on the results
* **Event** - trigger alerts if the quantity of events goes over a threshold
* **Outlier** - detect when a member of a group is different than the rest
